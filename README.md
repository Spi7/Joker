🃏 Game Rules
- Each game includes 3 players.

- At the start, every player receives 18 cards.

- A visible 3-second countdown will begin before the game starts.

- You will see a “Grab” button next to each of your two opponents.
Clicking this lets you steal one random card from that player.

- You can only grab from other players, not yourself.

- You may only play pairs — two cards of the same value, like two 5s or two Queens.

- This is a real-time free-for-all battle, not a turn-based game. You can play your cards at any moment!

- The first player to play all their cards wins the game.
