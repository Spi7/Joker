## üéÆ Game Rules

- Each game requires **3 players**.
- At the start, **each player receives 18 cards**.
- A **visible 3-second countdown** will begin before the game starts.
- You will see a **"Take" button** next to each of your two opponents:
  - Clicking it **steals one random card** from that opponent.
  - You **cannot** grab cards from yourself.
- You may **only play pairs** by selecting two same cards and press **Send Button**:
  - Two cards of the same value, such as two 5s or two Queens.
- The game is a **real-time free-for-all**:
  - **Not** turn-based ‚Äî you can play and steal cards **at any moment**!
- The **first player to play all their cards wins** the game.
- When a player has last card, their card **CANNOT** be steal
